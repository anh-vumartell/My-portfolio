# My-portfolio
My first website ever. 
I started my coding journey in April, 2020. Being home-quarantined I had a serious thought of my future career, which I can still work, contribute while being at home. 
So indeed I've been at home for almost 2 years looking after my first-born. It's time I start doing something new, something challenging. I chose to learn to code. 

This first website is a final product of my 3-month learning basic HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
